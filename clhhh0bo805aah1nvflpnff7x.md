👋 Welcome back, dear readers! 👋

📚 It's been a while since we last spoke, but I hope you've been doing well during the break. 🌞

💻 As for me, I'm excited to announce that I'm back and ready to jump back into the world of design systems. 💻

🎨 During my time away, I've been focusing on school and work, but I never forgot about my passion for design and development. 🎨

🚀 Now, I'm thrilled to share that I'm going to be focusing on design systems moving forward. 🚀

👨‍💻 I'll be taking you on a journey from the beginning of my process, starting with designing the application on Figma, developing it, and documenting the design systems as I go. 👨‍💻

🤔 If you're unfamiliar with design systems, they're a collection of reusable components, guidelines, and standards that help streamline the design and development process. 🤔

🤝 By using design systems, we can create consistent and cohesive designs, improve collaboration, and increase efficiency. 🤝

🎯 My goal is to create a comprehensive design system that can be used for any project, big or small. 🎯

📈 I'll be sharing my progress, from the initial design concepts to the final product. I'll also discuss the challenges I face and the solutions I come up with, so you can learn from my experiences. 📈

👉 I invite you to join me on this exciting design and development journey. Together, we can create something amazing and useful for the world. Let's explore the world of design systems and make something great!
